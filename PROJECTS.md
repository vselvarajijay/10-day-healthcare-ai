  - A demo video or link (if applicable) showcasing how your project works. This can be included as a link in the README file.
  - All relevant datasets and tools used should be referenced and linked in your README file.

## Step 2: Publish Your Project on GitHub
- Create a new repository on your GitHub account for the project.
- Push all your code, documentation, and resources to this repository.
- Ensure that the repository is public so it can be viewed and accessed by others.
- **Important**: Include a note in your README file acknowledging that this project is part of the Generative AI in Healthcare course, and that feedback from Vijay Selvaraj is requested.

## Step 3: Share Your Project on LinkedIn
- Write a LinkedIn post that describes your project, the challenges you faced, what you learned, and how it could be applied in real-world scenarios.
- Include a link to your GitHub repository in the LinkedIn post.
- Tag [Vijay Selvaraj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vijayselvaraj/) in your LinkedIn post so that he can provide feedback and promote your work to his network.

## Step 4: Notify via GitHub
- After publishing your project, create a GitHub issue in your repository titled "Request for Feedback."
- In the issue, include a link to your LinkedIn post where you shared the project.
- Tag @VijaySelvaraj (if applicable) within the issue to notify him of your submission.

# Projects for Submission

## Project 1: AI-Powered Personalized Treatment Recommendation System

### Project Overview
Build an AI-powered system that recommends personalized treatment plans based on patient data such as demographics, medical history, and genetic information.

### Key Features
- Use a dataset like [MIMIC-III](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/) for patient records.
- Implement a machine learning model (e.g., random forest, neural network) that predicts the most effective treatment based on input data.
- Integrate a simple web interface or API where users can input patient data and receive treatment recommendations.

### Submission Requirements
- A detailed `README.md` file explaining the project, how to set up and run the system, and the datasets used.
- Python code for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- A demo of the system, either via a video or live deployment (e.g., using Flask or Django).

## Project 2: AI-Driven Drug Discovery Pipeline

### Project Overview
Create a pipeline that uses AI to identify potential drug candidates by predicting drug-target interactions.

### Key Features
- Use a dataset like [DrugBank](https://go.drugbank.com/releases/latest) to train the model.
- Implement a generative model (e.g., Variational Autoencoder, GAN) to generate novel drug compounds.
- Incorporate a predictive model to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the generated compounds.
- Visualize the chemical structures and the results of the predictions.

### Submission Requirements
- A detailed `README.md` file explaining the project, including the data sources, model architectures, and the pipeline workflow.
- Python code for data handling, model development, and compound generation.
- Documentation of the results, including the generated compounds and their predicted properties.

## Project 3: AI-Powered Mental Health Chatbot
