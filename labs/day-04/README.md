## Day 4: AI in Drug Discovery and Development

### Lab 4: Molecular Structure Generation Using GANs
**Objective**: Use GANs to generate novel molecular structures for drug discovery.

**Content**:
- Overview of molecular representation (e.g., SMILES) and its role in drug discovery
- Implementation of a GAN to generate new molecular structures
- Evaluating the generated molecules for drug-likeness and novelty
- Visualization of molecular structures and discussion on potential applications
- Ethical considerations in AI-driven drug discovery
