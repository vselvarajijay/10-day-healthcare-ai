## Day 5: Ethical AI in Healthcare

### Lab 5: Detecting Bias in AI Models
**Objective**: Learn how to detect and mitigate bias in healthcare AI models.

**Content**:
- Introduction to bias and fairness in AI
- Analyzing bias in a pre-trained healthcare model using fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equalized odds)
- Implementing techniques to mitigate bias (e.g., re-sampling, re-weighting)
- Evaluating the impact of bias mitigation on model performance
- Discussion on ethical implications and the importance of fairness in healthcare AI
