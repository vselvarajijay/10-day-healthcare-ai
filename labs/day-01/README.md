## Day 1: Foundational Understanding of Generative AI in Healthcare

### Lab 1: Introduction to GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)
**Objective**: Learn how GANs work by building a simple GAN to generate images from the MNIST dataset.

**Content**:
- Overview of GAN architecture (Generator and Discriminator)
- Implementation of a basic GAN in TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Training the GAN on the MNIST dataset
- Visualization of generated images
- Discussion on how GANs can be applied to healthcare data (e.g., generating synthetic medical images)
