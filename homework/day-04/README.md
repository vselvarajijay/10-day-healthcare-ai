## Day 4: AI in Drug Discovery and Development

### Assignment 1:
Build a basic machine learning model to predict drug-target interactions using a publicly available dataset like DrugBank. Document the model development process in a LinkedIn article and explain how generative AI could improve drug discovery.

### Assignment 2:
Write a research proposal for using generative AI in a specific area of drug discovery (e.g., novel compound generation). Outline the potential benefits, challenges, and ethical considerations. Publish your proposal on LinkedIn.
