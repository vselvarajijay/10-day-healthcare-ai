## Day 2: Generative AI for Precision Medicine and Genomics

### Assignment 1:
Develop a Python script that uses a pre-trained model (such as TensorFlow or PyTorch) to predict genetic predispositions to a specific disease using a small, synthetic genomic dataset. Document the process in a LinkedIn article, including detailed comments and explanations.

### Assignment 2:
Create a LinkedIn presentation that explains how generative AI could be used to identify new genetic markers for a specific condition. Use case studies or examples from research papers to support your argument.
