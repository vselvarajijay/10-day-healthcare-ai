## Day 8: AI in Preventive Healthcare

### Assignment 1:
Create a predictive model using public health data to identify high-risk individuals for a specific chronic condition (e.g., diabetes). Document your model development process and discuss how it could be integrated into a preventive healthcare program. Share your work on LinkedIn.

### Assignment 2:
Write a policy brief on how AI can be used to improve public health outcomes in preventive care. Focus on one specific area (e.g., vaccination, early screening) and provide evidence-based recommendations. Publish your policy brief on LinkedIn.
