## Day 3: Integration with Healthcare Systems and Electronic Health Records (EHRs)

### Assignment 1:
Design a data architecture diagram for integrating a generative AI model with an EHR system. Post your design and a brief explanation on LinkedIn, highlighting potential data flow, security concerns, and how the model would interact with patient data.

### Assignment 2:
Write a Python script that simulates the integration of AI with a mock EHR system. The script should take patient data as input, process it using a simple AI model, and output a generated clinical note. Share your script and explanation on LinkedIn.
