## Project 2: AI-Driven Drug Discovery Pipeline

### Project Overview
Create a pipeline that uses AI to identify potential drug candidates by predicting drug-target interactions.

### Key Features
- Use a dataset like [DrugBank](https://go.drugbank.com/releases/latest) to train the model.
- Implement a generative model (e.g., Variational Autoencoder, GAN) to generate novel drug compounds.
- Incorporate a predictive model to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the generated compounds.
- Visualize the chemical structures and the results of the predictions.

### Submission Requirements
- A detailed `README.md` file explaining the project, including the data sources, model architectures, and the pipeline workflow.
- Python code for data handling, model development, and compound generation.
- Documentation of the results, including the generated compounds and their predicted properties.
