# Project Submission Guidelines

## Step 1: Prepare Your Project for Submission
- Ensure your project includes the following:
  - A detailed `README.md` file that explains the project’s purpose, how to set it up, how to use it, and any specific requirements or dependencies.
  - Well-documented code, including comments and explanations where necessary.
  - A demo video or link (if applicable) showcasing how your project works. This can be included as a link in the README file.
  - All relevant datasets and tools used should be referenced and linked in your README file.

## Step 2: Publish Your Project on GitHub
- Create a new repository on your GitHub account for the project.
- Push all your code, documentation, and resources to this repository.
- Ensure that the repository is public so it can be viewed and accessed by others.
- **Important**: Include a note in your README file acknowledging that this project is part of the Generative AI in Healthcare course, and that feedback from Vijay Selvaraj is requested.

## Step 3: Share Your Project on LinkedIn
- Write a LinkedIn post that describes your project, the challenges you faced, what you learned, and how it could be applied in real-world scenarios.
- Include a link to your GitHub repository in the LinkedIn post.
- Tag [Vijay Selvaraj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vijayselvaraj/) in your LinkedIn post so that he can provide feedback and promote your work to his network.

## Step 4: Notify via GitHub
- After publishing your project, create a GitHub issue in your repository titled "Request for Feedback."
- In the issue, include a link to your LinkedIn post where you shared the project.
- Tag @VijaySelvaraj (if applicable) within the issue to notify him of your submission.
