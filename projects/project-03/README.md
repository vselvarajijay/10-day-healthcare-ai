- Add a feature that provides users with links to mental health resources based on their input.

### Submission Requirements
- A detailed `README.md` file describing the project, including the architecture of the chatbot, datasets used, and ethical considerations.
- Python code for the chatbot, including NLP models and conversation logic.
- A demonstration of the chatbot in action, either through a video or live demo link.
