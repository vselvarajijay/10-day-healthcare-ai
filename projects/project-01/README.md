## Project 1: AI-Powered Personalized Treatment Recommendation System

### Project Overview
Build an AI-powered system that recommends personalized treatment plans based on patient data such as demographics, medical history, and genetic information.

### Key Features
- Use a dataset like [MIMIC-III](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/) for patient records.
- Implement a machine learning model (e.g., random forest, neural network) that predicts the most effective treatment based on input data.
- Integrate a simple web interface or API where users can input patient data and receive treatment recommendations.

### Submission Requirements
- A detailed `README.md` file explaining the project, how to set up and run the system, and the datasets used.
- Python code for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- A demo of the system, either via a video or live deployment (e.g., using Flask or Django).
